# Ezra's Daily Standup Routine

## 04-12

 -  Created the README and Backlog files for our repo, and also added Riley and Alberto to the repo.
 
## 04-16

 -  Created and uploaded the simple React program that renders a link to the users' selected social media site to the screen
 
 ## 04-22
 
 - Uploaded the framework website for the API and also included support to input-based redirection. We have successfully found the APIs for Twitter and Reddit, and will still keep working on implementing the API in the local webpage.
 - Added the framework for the API and will now keep working with the API and figuring out which feeds get priority and storing unloaded posts behind the overflow div in CSS.

## 04-26

 - Redid the onUpdate function for the input bar. Also added support for the libraries. Still working on importing the libraries and incorporating them in the file.
 
## 04-30

 - Figured out how to implement the reading of the input value and changing the state accordingly. We will incorporate the APIs soon, but I have to complete the value reading function.
 
## 05-3
 - Need to figure out how to save and read the state of the input bar, but the function is not getting to the other function that saves it. That should be pretty simple, so I can spend the weekend working on it. We are now going to experiment with APIs and start linking them to website files and send and receive HTTP requests.


# WE GOT THE REDDIT API WORKING  BOIIIIIISSS!!!!!!!
 - This is the best day of our lives. We got the Reddit API working, and the user can access their own posts and every individual subreddit on the Internet.
